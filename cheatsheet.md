This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Our game is pretty simple to play. The player will be presented with a text description of the house and will then be prompted to start. 

>To start the game the player must type "ENTER HOUSE" in the terminal.

Once started the player will be in the house's Foyer and will be given 4 room options to explore.

>To choose a room and explore the player must enter the name of one of these 4 room options : "THE ATTIC", "SALLY'S ROOM", "THE KITCHEN", or "THE BASEMENT".

After choosing a room, the player will be given a description of the room and a list of collectable objects. 

>To collect an object the player must enter it's name. To continue exploring after collecting an object the player will need to type in "ENTER".

>When the player is finished looking through the house's rooms and collecting objects they can type in "NO" when asked the "Would you like to keep exploring question". This will take us to the end of the game where the player's final choice based on their evidence will determine their fate.

4 Possible game endings:
At the end of the game the player will be asked "Do you believe in ghosts?", they could either answer "YES" or "NO". In addition to their answer our game will take into account the objects they collected during their gameplay and whether or not any of those objects are "haunted". 

"Do you believe in ghosts?"
>YES, (Didn't pick up a haunted object): New player description, "You start your new life mission to prove the existence of ghosts..."
>YES, (Collected a haunted object): New player description, "You proved the existence of ghosts and become a world renowned ghost-hunter..."
>NO, (Didn't pick up a haunted object): New player description, "You never believed in ghost and this house didn't have any proof to change your mind. You give up ghost-hunting."
>NO, (Collected a haunted object): New player description. "You didn't believe in ghosts but some of the items you collected seem off. They might just chage your mind..."

Those are all the commands in our game. As the player goes through the game we have these command options printed in the terminal so that the player doesn't get confused with their options. We still added a cheat sheet because of the rubric requirements of this project but even if we didn't have a cheat sheet attached the player should still be able to go through our game with ease.
