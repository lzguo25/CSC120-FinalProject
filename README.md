# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 - Overall we as a group assigned ourselves classes to work on, for example, I worked on creating the HauntedHouse class and all of the methods for that class. Together we all contributed to the GameLoop file.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Through this project I definitely got more practice implementing everything together. It was pretty frustrating at times because there were so many components to keep track of: conditionals and nested conditionals, nested while loop, Scanners, and just keeping track of the direction the game was going based on the user response. I don’t think I necessarily learned anything completely different while completing this project, but I do think that it made me a better programmer, since I was able to help my teammates debug code and problems that I had run into throughout the semester.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - I don’t think anything game-wise I would want to implement differently, but something that I wish we did better as a team would be setting concrete plans. We had an idea at the beginning, but then my teammates decided to change the ending of our game right before reading-period, and it felt stressful. While we were able to figure out how to change the ending, I think we would have worked a lot more efficiently if we had discussed potential roadblocks and changes to use as backup before starting to code the assignment.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - If we had unlimited time, I think we would have wanted to add some images or even sound effects if possible, just to add to the theme of a haunted house. I think if we knew how to implement graphics and animations, then we would have wanted to change some fonts, have a text box, etc. Right now we have a text-based game, but if we had unlimited time (and infinite knowledge of programming), we would have wanted to transform it into something even more interactive.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - I think the most helpful feedback was from a classmate during the code review sessions. I think that having someone look at the code and asking questions such as, “are the responses case-sensitive,” and “how are you going to display the objects,” and “how is the ending determined,” made us really think about what we could implement to make everything more efficient.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - Don’t be afraid to voice your opinion. It will help guide the team's progress and it will save you a lot of time and stress if you tell everyone your concerns beforehand rather than run into them and get upset and frustrated. Compromising and understanding the perspective of another teammate is valuable. Just make sure you understand why we take a certain approach and why we should take their approach or why we should take your approach.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
- I thought our team dynamic worked well in which we all assigned ourselves tasks and updated each other on our progress. Something that I found frustrating at first was that it felt like I was doing significantly more work on the project than my team members. It was frustrating, since we assigned ourselves classes to work on, but then the things that we discussed on coding such as an inventory or objects weren’t completed by my teammates, so I wasn’t sure how to proceed. For a while I just had to write descriptions and loops and conditionals within the GameLoop and it felt counterproductive. It was also frustrating since we changed the trajectory of the game right before the reading period started, and my teammates were bringing up more design elements such as images before we had the logic of the game or the ending completed. But once classes were over we had more time to communicate and work on the project and implement all the different classes together.
